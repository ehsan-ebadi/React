# Definition
- `State` is a JavaScript object that stores component-specific data and determines a component's behavior and rendering. State allows React components to create dynamic and interactive UIs by enabling them to manage and update their internal data.
- Anything that start with *use* like `useState`, `useEffect`, ... are React Hook.
