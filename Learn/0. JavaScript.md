# Rest and Spread Operator
- The spread operator (`...`)
  - allows an iterable (like an array) to be expanded into individual elements. It's used to make copies of arrays or objects, merge arrays, and more.
  - Used to spread elements, making copies, merging arrays/objects, etc.
- The rest parameter (`...`)
  - allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It's used in function definitions to capture all remaining parameters into a single array parameter.
  - Used to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, typically in function definitions.

```javascript
const [primaryGenre, secondaryGenre, ...otherGenres] = genres;
console.log(primaryGenre, secondaryGenre, otherGenres);

const newGenres = ["epic fantasy", ...genres];
newGenres;

const updatedBook = {
  ...book,
  // Adding a new property
  moviePublicationDate: "2001-12-19",

  // Overwriting an existing property
  pages: 1210,
};
updatedBook;
```

# Template Literals
- Template literals allow you to embed expressions and multiline strings directly within backtick (`) characters.

```javascript
const summary = `${title}, a ${pages}-page long book, was written by ${author} and published in ${
  publicationDate.split("-")[0]
}`;
summary;
```

# Ternaries Instead of if else Statements
- It provides a shorthand for the if...else statement. 

```javascript
const summary = `${title}, a ${pages}-page long book, was written by ${author} and published in ${
  publicationDate.split("-")[0]
)}. The book has ${hasMovieAdaptation ? "" : "not"} been adapted as a movie`;
summary;

const pagesRange = pages > 1000 ? "over a thousand" : "less than 1000";
pagesRange;
console.log(`The book has ${pagesRange} pages`);
```

# Arrow Functions
- Arrow functions, provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They are often used to simplify the syntax of shorter functions and to lexically bind the this value.

```javascript
const getYear = (str) => str.split("-")[0];
console.log(getYear(publicationDate));

const summary = `${title}, a ${pages}-page long book, was written by ${author} and published in ${getYear(
  publicationDate
)}. The book has ${hasMovieAdaptation ? "" : "not"} been adapted as a movie`;
summary;
```

# Short Circuiting And Logical Operators
- Short-circuiting is a behavior of logical operators where the second operand is evaluated only if the first operand doesn't determine the result. This is particularly useful when dealing with conditional expressions.

```javascript
console.log(true && "Some string");
console.log(false && "Some string");
console.log(hasMovieAdaptation && "This book has a movie");

// falsy: 0, '', null, undefined
console.log("jonas" && "Some string");
console.log(0 && "Some string");

console.log(true || "Some string");
console.log(false || "Some string");

console.log(book.translations.spanish);

const spanishTranslation = book.translations.spanish || "NOT TRANSLATED";
spanishTranslation;

console.log(book.reviews.librarything.reviewsCount);
const countWrong = book.reviews.librarything.reviewsCount || "no data";
countWrong;

const count = book.reviews.librarything.reviewsCount ?? "no data";
count;
```

# Optional Chaining
- Optional chaining is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) that provides a concise way to access properties of an object when there's a possibility that the property might not exist (i.e., it could be null or undefined). It simplifies the process of checking for nested properties within objects without causing errors like TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined.
- The optional chaining operator is represented by a question mark (?). It can be placed before each dot (.) or bracket ([]) that accesses a property or method of an object.

```javascript
function getTotalReviewCount(book) {
  const goodreads = book.reviews?.goodreads?.reviewsCount;
  const librarything = book.reviews?.librarything?.reviewsCount ?? 0;
  librarything;
  return goodreads + librarything;
}

console.log(getTotalReviewCount(book));
```

# The Array map Method
- The `map()` method in JavaScript is a higher-order function used to iterate over an array and transform each element of the array into a new element based on a callback function. It creates a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element in the array.

```javascript
const books = getBooks();
books;

const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((el) => el * 2);
console.log(x);

const titles = books.map((book) => book.title);
titles;

const essentialData = books.map((book) => ({
  title: book.title,
  author: book.author,
  reviewsCount: getTotalReviewCount(book),
}));
essentialData;
```

# The Array filter Method
- The `filter()` method in JavaScript is another higher-order function used to iterate over an array, filter out elements that do not meet a specified condition, and create a new array containing only the elements that pass the condition. It does not modify the original array; instead, it returns a new array.

```javascript
const longBooksWithMovie = books
  .filter((book) => book.pages > 500)
  .filter((book) => book.hasMovieAdaptation);
longBooksWithMovie;

const adventureBooks = books
  .filter((books) => books.genres.includes("adventure"))
  .map((book) => book.title);
adventureBooks;
```

# The Array reduce Method
- The `reduce()` method in JavaScript is a higher-order function used to iterate over an array and accumulate a single result by applying a provided callback function to each element of the array. It "reduces" the array to a single value. The accumulator is the result of the previous callback invocation, and the current element is the current value being processed.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
console.log(sum); // Output: 10
```

# The Array sort Method
- The `sort()` method in JavaScript is used to sort the elements of an array in place and return the sorted array. By default, the sort() method sorts the elements as strings in lexicographical (dictionary) order.
- By `slice()` we make a copy of array, so the original array will not be modified.

```javascript
const arr = [3, 7, 1, 9, 6];
const sorted = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);
sorted;
arr;

const sortedByPages = books.slice().sort((a, b) => a.pages - b.pages);
sortedByPages;
```

# Working With Immutable Arrays
- Arrays whose elements cannot be changed after the array is created.

```javascript
// Add book object to array
const newBook = {
  id: 6,
  title: "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",
  author: "J. K. Rowling",
};
const booksAfterAdd = [...books, newBook];
booksAfterAdd;

// Delete book object from array
const booksAfterDelete = booksAfterAdd.filter((book) => book.id !== 3);
booksAfterDelete;

// Update book object in the array
const booksAfterUpdate = booksAfterDelete.map((book) =>
  book.id === 1 ? { ...book, pages: 1210 } : book
);
booksAfterUpdate;
```

# Asynchronous JavaScript Promises
- Promises are a powerful mechanism introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) for managing asynchronous operations and handling their results or errors in a more readable and manageable way.

```javascript
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));

console.log("jonas");
```

# Asynchronous JavaScript Async Await
- Asynchronous JavaScript programming with `async` and `await` is a modern approach introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) for simplifying the syntax of working with promises. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, making it easier to manage and understand asynchronous operations.
  - `await` pauses the execution of the async function and waits for the promise to resolve or reject. It can only be used inside an `async` function. 

```javascript
async function getTodos() {
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
}

getTodos();

console.log("jonas");
```
