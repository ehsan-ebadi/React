# Definition
- `Controlled elements` refer to form elements whose value is controlled by React state. Unlike uncontrolled components where the form data is handled by the DOM itself, in controlled components, React maintains the state of the form elements.
- State vs. Props

# Thinking in React (number 3 & 4 are State Mangement)
1. Breake the desired UI into components and establish the componenet tree
2. Build a static version in React (without state)
3. Think about state:
   - When to use state
   - Types of state: local vs. global

4. Establish data flow:
   - One-way data flow
   - Child-to-parent communication
   - Accessing global state
