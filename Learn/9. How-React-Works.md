# Definitions
- `Component` is a description of a piece of UI.
  - A component is a function that returns React elements (element tree), usually written as JSX
  - Blueprint or Template

- `Component Instance` are created when we use components
  - React internally calls Tab()
  - Actual physical manifestation of a component
  - Has its own state and props
  - Has a lifecycle (can be born, live and die)

- `React Element`, JSX is converted to `React.createElement()` function calls
  - A React element is the result of these function calls
  - Information necessary to create DOM elements

- `DOM Element (HTML)` is actual visual representation of the component instance in the browser.

- How Rendering works

- How Diffing works
  - In this app, if we Hide details in TabContent of Tab1, then go to Tab2, It will be hide. But if we go to Tab3 (`DifferentContent`) and come back to Tab1, the content will be shown because the content has changed.
  - We can overcome this problem and reset TabContent in each changing if Tab, by using key prop for each Tab.
 
- `Key Prop` is a special prop that we use to tell the diffing algorithm that an element is unique.
  - Allows React to distinguish between multiple instances of the same component type.
  - When a key stays the same across renders, the element will be kept in the DOM even if the position in the tree change ⇨ Using keys in lists (Stable key)

  - When a key changes between renders, the element will be destroyed and a new one will be created even if the position in the tree is the same as before  ⇨  Using keys to reset state (Changing key)

# Summary
- A `component` is (`function Question()`) like a blueprint for a piece of UI that will eventually exist on the screen. When we **use** (`<Question />`) a component, React creates a `component instance`, which is like an actual physical manifestation of a component, containing props, state, and more. A component instance, when rendered, will return a `React element`.
- `Rendering` only means calling component functions and calculating what DOM elements need to be inserted, deleted, or updated. It has nothing to do with writing to the DOM. Therefore,each time a component instance is rendered and re-rendered, the function is called again.
- Only the initial app render and state updates can cause a render, which happens for the entire application, not just one single component.
- When a component instance gets re-render, all its children will get re-render as well. This doesn`t mean that all children will get updated in the DOM, thanks to reconciliation, which checks which elements have actually changed between two renders. But all this re-rendering can still have an impact on performance.
- `Diffing` is how React decides which DOM elements need to be added or modified. If, between renders, a certain React element stays at the same position in the element tree, the corresponding DOM eleemnt and component state will stay the same. If the element changed to a different position, or if it`s a different element type, the DOM element and state will be destroyed.
- Giving elements a `key prop` allows React to distinguish between multiple component instances. When a key stays the same across renders, the element is kept in the DOM. This is why we need to use keys in lists. When we change the key between renders, the DOM element will be destroyed and rebuilt. We use this as a trick to reset state.
- Never declare a new component inside another component! Doing so will re-create the nested component every time the parent component re-renders. React will always see the nested component as new, and therefore reset its state each time the parent state is updated.
- The logic that produces JSX output for a component instance (render logic) is not allowed to produce any side effects: no API calls, no timers, no object or variable mutations, no state updated. Side effects are allowed in event handlers and `useEffect`
- The DOM is updated in the commit phase, but not by React, but by a "renderer" called ReactDOM. That's why we always need to include both libraries in a React web app project. We can use other renderers to use React on different platforms, for example to build mobile or native apps 
- Multiple state updates inside an event handler function are batched, so they happen all at once, causing only one re-render. This means we can not access a state variable immediately after updating it: state updates are asynchronous. Since React 18, batching also happens in timeouts, promises, and native event handlers. 
- When using events in event handlers, we get access to a synthetic event object, not the browser's native object, so that events work the same way across all browsers. The difference is that most synthetic events bubble, including focus, blur, and change, which do not bubble as native browser events. Only the scroll event does not bubble 
- React is a library, not a framework. This means that you can assemble your application using your favorite third-party libraries. The downside is that you need to find and learn all these additional libraries. No problem, as you will learn about the most commonly used libraries in this course .
