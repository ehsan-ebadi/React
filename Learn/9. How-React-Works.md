- Install all necessary packages from `package.json`
```bash
npm i
```
- Run the app
```bash
npm start
```

# Definitions
- `Component` is a description of a piece of UI.
  - A component is a function that returns React elements (element tree), usually written as JSX
  - Blueprint or Template

- `Component Instance` are created when we use components
  - React internally calls Tab()
  - Actual physical manifestation of a component
  - Has its own state and props
  - Has a lifecycle (can be born, live and die)

- `React Element`, JSX is converted to `React.createElement()` function calls
  - A React element is the result of these function calls
  - Information necessary to create DOM elements

- `DOM Element (HTML)` is actual visual representation of the component instance in the browser.

- How Rendering works

- How Diffing works
  - In this app, if we Hide details in TabContent of Tab1, then go to Tab2, It will be hide. But if we go to Tab3 (`DifferentContent`) and come back to Tab1, the content will be shown because the content has changed.
  - We can overcome this problem and reset TabContent in each changing if Tab, by using key prop for each Tab.
 
- `Key Prop` is a special prop that we use to tell the diffing algorithm that an element is unique.
  - Allows React to distinguish between multiple instances of the same component type.
  - When a key stays the same across renders, the element will be kept in the DOM even if the position in the tree change ⇨ Using keys in lists (Stable key)

  - When a key changes between renders, the element will be destroyed and a new one will be created even if the position in the tree is the same as before  ⇨  Using keys to reset state (Changing key)
