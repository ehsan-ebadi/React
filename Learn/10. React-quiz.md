# Definition
- `useReducer` is a hook in React that is used for managing complex state logic in functional components. It provides an alternative to useState and is particularly useful when the state logic involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
- State Management with `useState` is not enough in certain situations and we should use `useReducer`:
  - When components have a lot of state variables and state updates, spread across many event handlers all over the component
  - When multiple state updates need to happen at the same time (as a reaction to the same event, like "starting a game")
  - When updating one piece of state depends on one or multiple other piece of state
