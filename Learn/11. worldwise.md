# Definition
- **React Router** is a library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation among different views of various components in a React application, allowing you to manage the URL and its related components dynamically. React Router helps create single-page applications with navigation that feels like a traditional multi-page application.
  - Routing Components
    - `BrowserRouter`: A router component that uses the HTML5 history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL. This is the standard router for web applications.
    - `HashRouter`: Uses the hash portion of the URL (e.g., example.com/#/about) to keep the UI in sync with the URL. Useful for static file servers.
    - `MemoryRouter`: Keeps the URL in memory (doesn't read or write to the address bar). Useful for testing or non-browser environments.
  - Route Components
    - `Route`: Renders a UI component when its path matches the current URL. You can specify the path and the component to render.
    - `Switch`: Renders the first Route or Redirect that matches the current location. This is useful for exclusive routing, ensuring only one route renders at a time.
    - `Redirect`: Navigates to a different route when rendered.
  - Navigation
    - `Link`: A component for navigating to different routes using the to prop. It prevents the default anchor tag behavior and uses the React Router mechanism.
    - `NavLink`: Similar to Link, but it adds styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.
  - Hooks
    - `useHistory`: Provides access to the history instance, allowing navigation and manipulation of the browser history.
    - `useLocation`: Returns the current location object, which represents the current URL.
    - `useParams`: Returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters. Useful for dynamic routing.
    - `useRouteMatch`: Matches the current URL with the provided path and returns match information.
  - Nested Routing
    - React Router allows nesting routes within other components, enabling complex routing configurations.
  - Index Route
    - Is a special type of route in React Router v6 and beyond that acts as the default child route for a parent route. It is rendered when no other child routes match the URL. Index routes are useful for providing a default view when a parent route is accessed without specifying a child route.

- **CSS Module**: Scoped CSS files that generate unique class names to avoid conflicts.
```javascript
import styles from './App.module.css';

function App() {
  return <div className={styles.app}>Hello, World!</div>;
}
```

- Storing state in the URL

- Dynamic Routes with URL parameters
  - `useParam`
  - Reading/Setting a query string

- Programmatic Navigation with `useNavigate`
  - Navigate to other page without user interaction like navigate to a new page after submitting a form 

- Programmatic Navigation with `<Navigate />` component
  - Act as redirect

# Create App
- Vite is a modern build tool.
```bash
npm create vite@4
# Project name: worldwise
# Select a framework: React
# Select a variant: JavaScript
npm i
npm run dev
```

- Open a new terminal and install ESLint
```bash
npm install eslint vite-plugin-eslint eslint-config-react-app --save-dev
```

- Create `.eslintrc.json` inside `src` directory
```json
{
    "extends": "react-app"
}
```

- Modify `vite.config.josn`
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import eslint from "vite-plugin-eslint";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), eslint()],
});
```

- Open a new terminal and install react-router
```bash
npm i react-router-dom@6
```

- Run fake API
```bash
npm i json-server
npm run server
