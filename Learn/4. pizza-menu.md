# Definitions
- **Component** is a JavaScript class or function that returns a JSX (JavaScript XML) element. Components are the building blocks of React applications and can be thought of as independent, reusable pieces of code that represent a part of the user interface.
- **JSX** (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which gets transformed into regular JavaScript function calls by a process called transpilation
  - **Imperative** JavaScript
    - In imperative programming, you describe "how" you want something done, step by step. Imperative code tends to be more verbose and focuses on the detailed instructions to achieve a particular outcome.
    - You explicitly define each step to achieve the desired outcome. This approach can be more verbose and harder to maintain, especially for complex UIs.
  - **Declarative** JSX in React
    - In declarative programming, you describe "what" you want to achieve without specifying the exact steps to achieve it. Declarative code is more concise and focuses on describing the desired outcome rather than the specific actions needed to achieve it. 
    - You describe what you want to render, and React takes care of the underlying DOM manipulation. This approach is more concise, readable, and maintainable, especially for building UIs with React components.
