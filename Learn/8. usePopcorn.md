# Definition
- Component size matters: Not too small and not too huge

- `Prop drilling` also known as "prop passing" or "component chaining," is a term used in React to describe the process of passing data from one component to another through props, even if the intermediate components do not directly use the data themselves.

- `Component Composition` is combining different components using the children prop (or explicitly defined props)
  - By this feature we can create highly reusable and flexible components and also fix prop drilling (great for layouts)

- `Passing an element as a prop` in React involves passing a React element (such as a component or JSX) from a parent component to a child component as a prop. This allows the child component to render or use the provided element within its own render method.
  - It is an alternative for Component Composition. This method is used in ReacŸÅ Router.
```javascript
// Component Composition
<Box>
    <MovieList movies={movies} />
</Box>

// Passing an element as a prop
<Box element={<MovieList movies={movies}} />
```

- `Prop type` is a feature used to document and validate the properties (props) that a component should receive. This helps to catch bugs by ensuring that the data passed to a component is of the correct type and structure. It serves as a form of type-checking for props in React components.

- Component lifecycle
  - Mount / Initial render
  - Re-render (Happens when: State change, Props change, Parent re-renders< Context changes)
  - Unmount
 
- Where to create Side Effects
