# Initialize
- Install **Quokka.js** extension, to run JS in VS Code and show values of objects.
- Start the extension by wrritting `quokka start` in Command Palette.

# Destructuring Objects and Arrays
- Destructuring in JavaScript is a way to extract values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables in a concise and readable manner.

# Rest and Spread Operator
- The spread operator (`...`)
  - allows an iterable (like an array) to be expanded into individual elements. It's used to make copies of arrays or objects, merge arrays, and more.
  - Used to spread elements, making copies, merging arrays/objects, etc.
- The rest parameter (`...`)
  - allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It's used in function definitions to capture all remaining parameters into a single array parameter.
  - Used to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, typically in function definitions.

```javascript
const [primaryGenre, secondaryGenre, ...otherGenres] = genres;
console.log(primaryGenre, secondaryGenre, otherGenres);

const newGenres = ["epic fantasy", ...genres];
newGenres;

const updatedBook = {
  ...book,
  // Adding a new property
  moviePublicationDate: "2001-12-19",

  // Overwriting an existing property
  pages: 1210,
};
updatedBook;
```

# Template Literals
- Template literals allow you to embed expressions and multiline strings directly within backtick (`) characters.

```javascript
const summary = `${title}, a ${pages}-page long book, was written by ${author} and published in ${
  publicationDate.split("-")[0]
}`;
summary;
```

# Ternaries Instead of if else Statements
- It provides a shorthand for the if...else statement. 

```javascript
const summary = `${title}, a ${pages}-page long book, was written by ${author} and published in ${
  publicationDate.split("-")[0]
)}. The book has ${hasMovieAdaptation ? "" : "not"} been adapted as a movie`;
summary;

const pagesRange = pages > 1000 ? "over a thousand" : "less than 1000";
pagesRange;
console.log(`The book has ${pagesRange} pages`);
```

# Arrow Functions
- Arrow functions, provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They are often used to simplify the syntax of shorter functions and to lexically bind the this value.

```javascript
const getYear = (str) => str.split("-")[0];
console.log(getYear(publicationDate));

const summary = `${title}, a ${pages}-page long book, was written by ${author} and published in ${getYear(
  publicationDate
)}. The book has ${hasMovieAdaptation ? "" : "not"} been adapted as a movie`;
summary;
```

# Short Circuiting And Logical Operators
- Short-circuiting is a behavior of logical operators where the second operand is evaluated only if the first operand doesn't determine the result. This is particularly useful when dealing with conditional expressions.

```javascript
console.log(true && "Some string");
console.log(false && "Some string");
console.log(hasMovieAdaptation && "This book has a movie");

// falsy: 0, '', null, undefined
console.log("jonas" && "Some string");
console.log(0 && "Some string");

console.log(true || "Some string");
console.log(false || "Some string");

console.log(book.translations.spanish);

const spanishTranslation = book.translations.spanish || "NOT TRANSLATED";
spanishTranslation;

console.log(book.reviews.librarything.reviewsCount);
const countWrong = book.reviews.librarything.reviewsCount || "no data";
countWrong;

const count = book.reviews.librarything.reviewsCount ?? "no data";
count;
```

# Optional Chaining
- Optional chaining is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) that provides a concise way to access properties of an object when there's a possibility that the property might not exist (i.e., it could be null or undefined). It simplifies the process of checking for nested properties within objects without causing errors like TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined.
- The optional chaining operator is represented by a question mark (?). It can be placed before each dot (.) or bracket ([]) that accesses a property or method of an object.

```javascript
function getTotalReviewCount(book) {
  const goodreads = book.reviews?.goodreads?.reviewsCount;
  const librarything = book.reviews?.librarything?.reviewsCount ?? 0;
  librarything;
  return goodreads + librarything;
}

console.log(getTotalReviewCount(book));
```

# The Array map Method
- The `map()` method in JavaScript is a higher-order function used to iterate over an array and transform each element of the array into a new element based on a callback function. It creates a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element in the array.

```javascript
const books = getBooks();
books;

const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((el) => el * 2);
console.log(x);

const titles = books.map((book) => book.title);
titles;

const essentialData = books.map((book) => ({
  title: book.title,
  author: book.author,
  reviewsCount: getTotalReviewCount(book),
}));
essentialData;
```

# The Array filter Method
- The `filter()` method in JavaScript is another higher-order function used to iterate over an array, filter out elements that do not meet a specified condition, and create a new array containing only the elements that pass the condition. It does not modify the original array; instead, it returns a new array.

```javascript
const longBooksWithMovie = books
  .filter((book) => book.pages > 500)
  .filter((book) => book.hasMovieAdaptation);
longBooksWithMovie;

const adventureBooks = books
  .filter((books) => books.genres.includes("adventure"))
  .map((book) => book.title);
adventureBooks;
```
